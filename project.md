# Project C


**Consider the following augmented grammar**

S’=> S
S => L = R
S => R
L => * R
L => id
R => L

Apply SLR parsing technique and demonstrate that there is a shift -reduce conflict by testing it by the string
id = id * id

## Prerequisites
1. The theoretical knowledge of each step (eg, LR(0) items construction, goto function, table creating
algorithm etc) is very necessary.
2. Motivate your choice in your report and explain any transformation you had to apply to your
grammar to make it fit the parser’s constraints
3. You have to demonstrate each module clearly while you are submitting your report.
4. You can choose the language of your own interest however you have to justify the motivation you
have while using that particular language.
5. Interactive demonstration of your project will increase your chance to obtain higher marks.
6. Project evaluation: Project completion and demonstration 20 marks
